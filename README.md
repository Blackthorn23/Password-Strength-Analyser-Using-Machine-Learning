# Password-Strength-Analyser-Using-Machine-Learning

## Description
This project is a **Password Strength Analyzer** built using **Machine Learning**.  
It classifies passwords as **"Weak"** or **"Strong"** based on various password characteristics.  

## Features
- ✅ Uses **Random Forest Classification** to predict password strength.  
- ✅ Trained on the **rockyou.csv** dataset of passwords with labeled strengths.  
- ✅ Preprocesses password data for better accuracy.  
- ✅ Helps in identifying weak passwords for enhanced security.
